### Notes

- In mapper.ini keep transitivity high.
- Processes in parrallel. Extraction of featues (each image a separate process). Also matching cam be done in parallel.
- Visualize in real time optical flow for keyframes (is a different local feature)
- To save time, save local features from keyframe selection
- For mapper, use tie points only from last 6 frames
